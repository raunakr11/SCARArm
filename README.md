The creative application of a SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) robot platform for pick-and-place tasks is presented in this article. The SCARA robot, which is well- known for its remarkable accuracy and adaptability, shows promise as an automated pick-and- place process solution that could improve productivity, accuracy, and overall quality of automation.

This report begins with a thorough introduction to the pick-and-place process and its inherent challenges. It then moves into an examination of the SCARA robot platform. Its positional control and articulated arm structure are two of its key attributes that are highlighted in this section, along with how these features contribute to its effectiveness in pick-and-place automation.

The report then presents the software, programming dimensions and the hardware of the SCARA robot system. The modelling of the 3D printed components is completed using AutoFusion360 and fabricated to integrate the software and hardware components with it. The hardware is comprised of an Arduino Uno R3, four NEMA 17 stepper motors, CNC shield v3, a servo motor for the end effector and a power supply. The applications are been incorporated as part of PC/laptops that commands the robot for the desired functionality using Forward and Inverse kinematics.

The report then shows the experimental results, effectively showcasing the prowess of the proposed SCARA robot platform in pick-and-place tasks. The results underscore heightened precision, reduced production timeâ€”a testament to the transformative impact of integrating SCARA robots in this application. The robot platform can be used for varied applications for which there will also be additional interfacing provided in future for the end users to train using learn and repeat approach.
